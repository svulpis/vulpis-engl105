# The Sea Level Story of the Past Two Decades
**This repository was created for Prof. Gotzler's English 105 class in the Fall 2022 semester at the University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill.**

- It contains the raw data set and the subset of data that was created by manipulating the raw data using Python3.

- The repository also includes the Python notebook that documents the process for crafting the subset of data from the original data.

---

## What is the purpose of this repository?
- The purpose of this repository is to bring awareness to the changes in sea level the Southeast Atlantic region has faced over the past 20 years.
- This data could be for climate scientists or just individuals interested in learning about climate impacts in recent years.

---

## Where is this data from?
- This data is from The Actuaries Climate Index (ACI) [website](https://actuariesclimateindex.org/data/).
>The data provided on this website is formatted differently than the data provided in this repository, but no values were altered. This was done to ensure the data could be easily displayed and referenced when manipulating it with Python3.

---

## What could this data be used for?
- This data could be used by environmental actuaries as a tool to predict future climate events.
- It could also be used by public policymakers as a guide for implementing plans to combat future severe climate events.
- Individuals in the general public could also use this repository to create a subset for the region they live in. 
>This could help them visualize how their region has changed in the last 20 years.
- For more information on how the Actuaries Climate Index is used, feel free to view the executive summary that they have published [here](https://actuariesclimateindex.org/wp-content/uploads/2016/04/ACI.ExecutiveSummary5.18.pdf).
